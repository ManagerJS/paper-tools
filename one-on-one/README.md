# One-on-One meeting Form

You should meet regularly with the people you manage. This is a great opportunity to build relationships and discover important issues and information.

See manager-tools.com for more great guidance on how to conduct one-on-ones.

You should always take notes at your one-on-ones. These are business meetings. Your people expect you to remember the things they tell you.

If you have a single office or travel rarely then it is often most effective to take notes on paper and store them in a binder. Old fashioned, but effective.  Plus taking notes on paper is proven to increase retention.

If you don’t have a single office then you might try taking notes on paper and then filing them digitally.  I find that a paper form plus Evernote is a great combination.

These are Evernote friendly, GTD friendly, disposable one-on-one forms.

## Evernote* Friendly Form

These forms are “Evernote Friendly” because they don’t use solid lines and do provide dotted lines to make handwritten notes easier to keep tidy.

## GTD* Friendly Form

These forms help you get stuff done by including a checklist you should run through in combination with every one-on-one you conduct.  

Having the checklist printed on the form makes it easy for you to remember the details. You will have greater peace of mind knowing that you will remember to perform every step.

Here are the simple steps to take:

1. **Fill in the header** The night before or morning of print all the forms for a day and fill in each header.
2. **Prepare my update** Take a moment to consider the topics you want to be sure to cover with this direct.
3. **Conduct** Actually hold the one-on-one with your direct.  Give them your undivided attention and take notes.
4. **Process for tasks** Make sure to review the meeting and make notes of any assignments.  It’s best if you can do this before the meeting ends. You may send them a reminder of commitments as well. At the least jot down the assignments in the “Future/Follow Up” section.
5. **Digitize** If you have a smartphone and an Evernote subscription then this is as simple as taking a picture of the document.  Otherwise you might scan them and send them to Evernote.
6. **File with metadata** Once you have your note in Evernote make sure to add some tags to make it easy to get at.

I recommend you add these tags:

- **DIRECT_NAME** The name of your direct spelled the same way every time.
- **o3** A tag representing that this was a one-on-one
- **YEAR** The current year
- **WeekNN** A tag for the current week of the year.

## Disposable Form

The form will help you prepare, conduct, file, and retrieve. But it’s physical form needn’t hang around cluttering your life.  Once you finish the last step on the checklist (filing it with metadata for retrieval) you should discard it securely.
